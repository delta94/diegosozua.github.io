    <h3 id="hi-im-diego-the-guy-behind-of-this-blog">Hi, I’m <strong>Diego</strong>, the guy behind of this blog!</h3>

<p>I’m software and web developer, musician (in my relax time). I live in Praia Grande, São Paulo.
I graduated in <em>system analysis and development</em> from Fatec-PG college.</p>

<p>I started work as a programmer in the early  of 2014, before that I had already taught the basic of computer design for teenagers using <strong>GIMP</strong> and <strong>Flash CS6</strong> tools in municipal educational system of the city.</p>

<p>That was a great challenge because I’ve never done anything like this before, I did not have experience to teach and I never used graphical tools before. After that I realized that I can go far away.</p>

<p>I started my career in technology as a computer repair technician and as a help desk technician in the early 2000s</p>

<p>Delphi was my first programming language, I had this course in a <em>“vocational courses”</em> that were very popular in Brazil in 90s and in the middle of 2000s.</p>

<p>The course was not as good as expected but it made me see the other side of technology that I did not know and I realized that technology was way beyond computer repair.</p>

<p>In 2010 I decided to go to college to learn more about software development and system analysis and here I am creating a blog to share my professional and life experience.</p>

<h3 id="why-did-you-decide-to-create-a-blog">Why did you decide to create a blog?</h3>

<p>The creation of blog is based on principle of: <strong>to put me in a good position in the job market</strong>, <strong>to share my knowledge</strong> and <strong>to share my hobbies</strong>.</p>

<p>The <strong>first</strong> reason came because I see the blog as a extension (a DLC?) of my <em>résumé</em>, everyone has an easy access to the internet nowaday so you are giving a chance to people to see how you do work and how you know use your ideas, after all who doesn’t like to see or have a <strong><em>“free sample”</em></strong> of your work or a product, isn’t it?</p>

<p>The <strong>second</strong> reason came because I was feeling that I needed to expose all of my <strong>raw accumulative knowledge</strong> in something or somewhere. Making some search on the internet I discover that, to retain <strong>75%</strong> learners need to put in practice what they learned and incredible <strong>90%</strong> learners approximately retain when they teach someone else/use immediately.</p>

<p>The blog came to help me mastery my develop and analysis skills, to learn how to refine my raw information in knowledge and my writing skills.</p>

<p>The <strong>third</strong> (the last but not least) reason came to share my hobbies, to share what I do like and don’t like to do, as Jesus said a more than 2000 years ago <strong><em>“It is not just bread that keeps people alive [Matthew 4:4]”</em></strong>. We only get one life, we don’t need spend it at all work. That’s why I going to share my likes to: games, music, books, foods, films and TV series, draw and arts and my faith.</p>

<h3 id="how-can-i-contact-you">How can I contact you?</h3>
<p>Do you want to chat, make a job proposal, give and receive advice/tips and so forth?</p>

We are unhappy because we neglect and buried our talents</p>

<h4 id="one-more-thing">One more thing</h4>
<p>You noticed that I’m not an <strong>“English native”</strong> not even an <strong>“Expert”</strong> but I’m writing in English because I want to get better and reach to the fluency. I’ll appreciate if you help me spend your precious time send me your suggestion and correction about my sentences. ;)</p>
