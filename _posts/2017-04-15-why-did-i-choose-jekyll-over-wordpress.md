### Wordpress has a huge community support, it has a lot of specialized sites, yadda yadda blogs, yadda yadda plugins, yadda yadda tutorials and yadda yadda yadda and yadda.

I'm considering that [you've already know why I decided to create a blog](https://diegosc.com/about/) so in this post, I'll explain why I chose [jekyll](https://jekyllrb.com/) over [wordpress](https://wordpress.org/).  

Few months ago, I had an idea for create my own blog. I was a little be frustrated at what was happening to my professional career then I got started search about ***"how to create a blog"***, ***"yadda reasons why you need a blog"***, ***"yadda reasons why your business should be writing a blog"***, ***"yadda things to know before you start a blog"***, so on and so forth.  

I'm a developer, so I needed to know which of these platforms I should choose to get started my blog. Throughout my searching in these blogs I realized that they were recommending to start with wordpress as a blog platform. Great, all I needed to do were using or create my own template, looking for a specialized wordpress hosting, set up my own domain and *voila*, my blog is ready to conquer the internet.

### But the things is not so simple as I thought

Wordpress is a free open-source content management system ***(CMS)*** based on *PHP* and *MySQL* and ~~I hate PHP~~ I don't know how to program in PHP **(Although I've already built a website in PHP and MySQL for my mom but it's in limbo of the internet)** I didn't want to a website on which I need maintenance a database or the maintenance to a programming language that ~~I hate~~ I don't know how to program.

As a good developer, I'd like to create my own template with my **HTML + CSS + Javascript** written by me but that task isn't so simple **"but not impossible"** and I was looking for a *minor learning curve* because I was in hurry to hosting my blog.  

### Jekyll as a solution

Jekyll is *[a simple, blog-aware, static site generator perfect for personal, project, or organization sites. Think of it like a file-based CMS, without all the complexity.](https://github.com/jekyll/jekyll/)*  

Jekyll was created using ruby and is installed as a rubygem. Jekyll is a static site. Static site is quick and cheap to develop and cheap to host, that's all what I was looking for!  

Although the benefit of static web (it loading faster) over other blogging frameworks I don't recommend a static web site neither for people that don't have any kind of skills such as:**HTML, CSS, Javascript(optional), Markdown and liquid templates** nor for whom want to create a e-commerce or confidential website, this is a job for a dynamic site like Wordpress.  

That's all folks, in the next post, I'll show you how can you create your own site/blog and hosting it on [github pages](https://pages.github.com/), all for free.  

One more thing, I'm one of the co-founders of [Weyes](http://weyes.com.br/) we're consulting and as soon as possible our courses will begin. We decided create our own blog to help us in the marketing and to promote our courses and I'm responsible to build the blog. With whole partners, can you guess which blog platform we choose to support ours blog, can you? If you said Wordpress, you're correct. A.S.A.P, I'll share it here **"obvious"** and I'll explain why we chose the Wordpress over a static site generator. cya!
