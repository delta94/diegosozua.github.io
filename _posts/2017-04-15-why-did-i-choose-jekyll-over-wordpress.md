### Wordpress has a huge community support, and it has a lot of specific sites, yadda blogs, yadda plugins, yadda tutorials and yadda yadda yadda and yadda.

I'm considering that [you've already know why I decided to create a blog](https://diegosc.com/about/) so in this post, you will know why I chose [Jekyll](https://jekyllrb.com/) over [Wordpress](https://wordpress.org/).  

A few months ago, I had an idea for creating my own blog.   

I was a little upset at what was happening to my professional career. Then I got started to search about ***"how to create a blog"***, ***"yadda reasons why you need a blog"***, ***"yadda reasons why your business should be writing a blog"***, ***"yadda things to know before you start a blog"***, so on and so forth.  

I’m a developer, so I needed to know which of these platforms I should choose to get started my blog. Throughout my searching, in these blogs, I realized that they were recommending to start with Wordpress as a blog platform. Great, all I needed to do were using or create my template, looking for a specialized Wordpress hosting, set up my domain and voila, my blog is ready to conquer the internet.

### But the things is not so simple as I thought

Wordpress is a free open-source content management system ***(CMS)*** based on *PHP* and *MySQL*.   

I don't know ~~I hate PHP~~  how to program in PHP **(Although I've already built a website in PHP and MySQL for my mom)**.   

I didn’t want to a website on which I need maintenance a database or the support a programming language that I don’t know how to program.

As a good developer, I'd like to create my template with my **HTML + CSS + Javascript** written by me, but that task isn't so simple **"but not impossible"** and I was looking for a *minor learning curve* because I was in hurry to hosting my blog.  

### Jekyll as a solution

Jekyll is *[a simple, blog-aware, static site generator perfect for personal, project, or organization sites. Think of it like a file-based CMS, without all the complexity.](https://github.com/jekyll/jekyll/)*  

Jekyll was created using Ruby and installed as a RubyGem. Jekyll is a static site. A static site is quick and cheap to develop and cheap to host, that’s all that I was looking for to build my blog.  

Although the benefit of the static web (it loads faster) over the other blogging frameworks.

Beside these, I recommend a static website neither for people that don’t have any skills such as **HTML, CSS, Javascript(optional), Markdown and Liquid templates** nor for whom want to create an e-commerce or confidential website; this is a job for a dynamic site like Wordpress.

That's all folks, in the next post, I'll show you how can you create your website/blog and hosting on [Github pages](https://pages.github.com/), all for free.  

One more thing, I'm one of the co-founders of [Weyes](http://weyes.com.br/) we’re consulting, and as soon as possible our courses will begin. We decided to create our blog to help us in the marketing and to promote our courses, and I’m responsible for build the blog. With full partners, can you guess which blog platform we choose to support our blog, can you? If you said Wordpress, you’re correct. A.S.A.P, I’ll share it here “obvious, ” and I’ll explain why we chose the Wordpress over a static site generator. Cya!
