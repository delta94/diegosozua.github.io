### Sometimes we need to get harder with ourselves. If you want to got to the next level, you're going to have force yourself a little more.

Yeah, I decided to not publish my posts in my native language *(Brazilian Portuguese)* anymore.  

Why? I did realize that, if you want to learn something new but this *"something new"* needs more immersion of you, you need to make these things part of your routine, part of your life.  

### Gym

Letâ€™s take an example of a gym. When you decide to go to the gym, you are worried about your health, you are not satisfied with your body shape or you need to gain or lose weight.   

Regardless with you want to gain or lose weight we need to put our body in extreme condition, for lose weight you need to burn fat, for gain weight and muscles you need to hurt them, need to lift heavy weight if you want to that they grow up.  

### Let's make tangible things

We need to do the same things if we want to learn a new programming language ***(despite I'm java programmer I didn't code anything in it almost 2 months)*** or want to learn a new instrument, to sing, to cook whatever, the ***I wanna*** is not enough, we need to make them tangible up, bring it to reality, put it in practice even if you make mistakes.  

You can only repair something that you created.  

As I said, I'm programmer and Brazilian **(Brazilian programmer lol)** I have skills that allow me to make bucks around the world, almost all information are in English, if you don't know English nowadays you're illiterate. I know that there are a bunch of people that don't know English and they live well but if you work with technology, if you do really wish to be up-to-date, you need English to read and to meet up new people, there is no escape!  

If you have any questions, please leave a comment below!
