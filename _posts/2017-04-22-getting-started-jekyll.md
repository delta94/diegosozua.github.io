### In this tutorial, you'll know how to host your website/blog/portfolio {or whatever you call it} using a static website + Github pages

In the previous post, [I said why I did choose Jekyll and I said a little bit about some of its advantages as a static website.](https://diegosc.com/why-did-i-choose-jekyll-over-wordpress)  

Jekyll is a static website written in Ruby. You can build templates with markdown, liquid templates and you can customize it with your own HTML and CSS plains. Jekyll is minimal, fast, secure and economic. You can find free themes, customize them and start to blog!  

I decided to turn this into a tutorial and I'd like to explain it as much as possible so I've split it into three parts.

### Part 1 -- Setting up the environment

Here I will show how to set up your environment and start your first project. I use Linux (Fedora 25) but I'll show how to set up Jekyll on X OS as well.  

> Windows is not officially supported, it's possible to get running on Windows using special instructions.

Summarizing, all you need to get started is a computer, a text editor and a minimal HTML and CSS know-how.

### Part 2 -- Exploring Jekyll directory structure

The Jekyll directory structure can scare anyone at the first time. I will show you how each folder works and your files such as *_config.yml*, *Gemfile*, and *Markdown*. I will show you where to find themes and how you can create your own theme.

### Part 3 -- Github and git

Github is where we're going to hosting our project. You will learn how to use git command to push your local project to Github pages server and how you can create and edit files in it.  

This is what you'll need to get started to use Jekyll, I'm sorry about few details but in the next post you will know every detail of each part of the tutorial. If you have any questions, please leave a comment below!
